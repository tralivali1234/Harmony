# Harmony

## Introduction

Harmony gives you an elegant and high level way to **alter functionality** in applications written in C#. It does this at **runtime** by monkey patching methods unlike other solutions that change the content of dll files.

This works great in Unity games and .NET applications and supports **Mono** and most **.NET Framework** versions except .NET Core. It is used in many mainstream Unity games.

Designed to be used by multiple users (usually called Mods) that would otherwise override each others hooks, it was originally created for the game [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com) and its large modding community by its creator [Andreas Pardeike](https://www.patreon.com/pardeike).

Enjoy!
